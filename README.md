# AMFOSS - TASKS

Heyyy I'm **CIA N S** not the Central Investigation Agency
but trust me I'm on a secret mission of my own:

- Becoming a pro at tech 
- Learning something new and exciting 
- One day drive my porsche.

I'm currently speedrunning my first year of B.tech **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri**

# Why should we choose you?

I am a hardworking and consistent individual. When I take up a task, I work on it relentlessly until I achieve the desired result. I never leave anything unfinished and make sure that every task I handle reaches its best possible outcome.Dedication and smart working are my key strengths.I am also deeply curious about new technologies and ideas.
Finding someone with this combination of dedication, curiosity, and consistency is rare‚Ä¶ and lucky for you, you just found me.

# How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I will actively take part in discussions, events, and projects organized by the club, making sure I stay consistent and fully committed. My focus is not only on learning for myself but also on contributing to the collective growth of the club.
So yes, I‚Äôll definitely support and uplift juniors in the maximum way possible. Don‚Äôt worry,I won‚Äôt spoonfeed them.I‚Äôll just hand them the whole recipe book instead.

# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

**Web Development** ‚Äì I love the idea of building something from scratch and seeing it come alive in the browser. Nothing beats the moment when I say ‚ÄúWOW!!!"

**Automotive Tech** ‚Äì As a future Porsche owner üèéÔ∏è, I want to dive deep into the tech behind cars, from electronics to smart systems. For me, it‚Äôs not just about driving one but also understanding the engineering that makes it possible.

**Arduino Programming** ‚Äì Working with microcontrollers fascinates me. I enjoy turning tiny circuits into impactful projects.

**Embedded Systems** ‚Äì This is where my branch (ECE) meets my passion. Combining hardware and software to solve problems feels like creating undercover tech gadgets for secret missions.

**Creative Thinking & Designing** ‚Äì I believe every mission needs style. I like approaching problems from fresh angles, designing solutions that are both effective and elegant.

**Problem Solving** ‚Äì At the end of the day, everything comes down to solving problems.

**Mic Enthusiast** ‚Äì I genuinely enjoy being on the mic and look forward to hosting events. If nothing else works out, at least I can keep everyone entertained while pretending I‚Äôm running a live CIA press conference.
