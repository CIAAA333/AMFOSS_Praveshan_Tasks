## Task 13 

LESSGO HUGO

__MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!__

For this task, I built and launched my very own portfolio website using Hugo.......
During this task, I encountered an issue where the best theme I chose was not supported by the Hugo version I had downloaded, which caused errors.
To resolve this, I researched compatible themes and then I selected a theme that worked seamlessly with my setup.


Finally, I deployed the site using GitHub Pages, making it live and accessible to the world. 
This task gave me hands-on experience with static site generators, theme customization, and deployment â€” and now I have a personal website to showcase my journey.
